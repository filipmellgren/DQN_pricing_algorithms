Configuration of parameters

Nash price: price from which each agent has no incentive to deviate from.
    No agent can be made better off by a unilateral change in price from a N.E.

Monopoly price: price that maximises the joint profits.
    Because of symmetry, the price is the same for both firms. 
    If not symmetric, the two firms maximise joint profit and split it equally.
