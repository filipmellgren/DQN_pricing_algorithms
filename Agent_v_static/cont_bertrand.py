    This environment represents a continuous world with two agents. The agents 
    may set discrete prices which generates profits depending on the joint 
    behaviour.
      
    In principle, the environment is similar to CartPole with the difference 
    that rows and columns (the state) are prices in the previous period.
    
    The state is defined as:
    state = np.array([reward[0], action[0], reward[1], action[1], eps, frame,
    cost0, cost1, vert0, vert1])
